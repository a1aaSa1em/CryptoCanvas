        <h2> NFT Fashion Across The Globe</h2> 
        <p class = "desgin"> 
            What does NFT fashion look like across all platforms?...<br>

            Within a short period of time, digital fashion has grown from the gaming world and the edges of the fashion industry into the general culture conversation. This is similar to how our lives have become more and more digitalized. After getting used to virtual fashion stars like Lil Miquela and virtual fashion shows, which were made easier by the pandemic, the next change that needs to happen is fashion colliding with non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which is already happening. The fashion business needs NFT to make digital clothes that can be sold and verified on the blockchain. Names are different because they are unique and can't be stolen because digital ownership is tracked. NFTs are also making their way into fashion at the same time that digital fashion is becoming popular and their appeal on the internet is growing. Recently, cryptoart has become very famous in the art world. For example, Grimes sold $6 million worth of digital art on Nifty Gateway, which Swiss art expert Simon de Pury compared to a "gold rush." Avogue Business's Innovation Editor, Maghan McDowell, said at the lecture, "Luxury fashion has been known for competition." "One thing that makes technology and sustainability different is that they facilitate teamwork." Many players must be involved with and invest in the new technologies in order to make the fashion business more digital and connected. Tommy Hilfiger's announcement that they will only use 3D design to make, develop, and sell pieces from the Spring 2022 clothing lines onward was a big turning point for digital fashion, according to McDowell. "Within a few years, our handheld devices will be replaced by hands-free devices," Kaspar said, predicting that these will be glasses that you can wear. "Now things get really interesting, and people who make fashion will quickly make a lot of money." When it comes to fashion using this technology, she thinks that attaching NFTs to a real item is simply the first step. The technology will get better over time, and Kaspar said, "Eventually you'll be able to buy your NFT fashion and then project it and wear it." This might be possible a lot sooner than we think as new technology keeps moving forward. With the idea that a new generation of customers will buy NFTs because their digital selves are just as important as their real ones, not just to play video games, Benoit Pagotto, Co-Founder and CEO of the virtual sneakers and collectibles company RTFKT, started the brand. They recently raised $8 million to support the future of digital fashion. In March, their 621 pairs of NFT trainers made with artist Fewocious sold for $3.1 million in just minutes. Pagato pushes us not to see NFTs as just digital items, but as a whole new medium, since they are big players in fashion's NFT game and the future of the fashion industry as a whole. At the lecture, he asked, "NTFs that are made today, what would they unlock in 100 years?" Based on its past, different masters, and changes over time, NFT is not a one-time thing. Most people will likely own digital things in the future, we believe. Brands should not see NFTs as a passing fad, but as a new platform that will change the fashion industry and the customer industry as a whole, says Pagotto.
