        <p class = "summary-text"> Maria, a clever fashion student at UAL, studying  creative computing in Holborn. 
            
            She was always interested by traditional clothing design and with modern technology. 
            
            She was known for wearing fascinating dresses around campus, and was famous because of this reason.
             One day, students were taught a lesson regarding Nfts, about potential to transform real-world designs and fashion 
            into digital formats. She went to that lesson and became even more fascinated. After that, she attended more lectures with Evan 
            on the holborn ual campus, she gets an idea about developing the world of Fashion NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. 
            "Why not actually combine her love and passion of fashion, with limitless potential digital arts, why no"
                
                


            <br><br> Hunger to learn this new concept, Maria marks her journey to design and create her own  idea of NFT fashion pieces. She collects data from Evan. She sees in her mind, a collection that goes beyond the physical reality with clothing that actually exist in shopping centre, and shift solely into digital sphere, but with true value and true style, she refers to this as digital tailoring

            future themes from her thoughts. She was so focus on her digital fashion Nfts, even forgoting saying hi, bye to her friend.
            She started missing seminars, because she was focuses  on her digital fashion initiative. 
            With that, she learns 3D modelling and animations; she was taught with Evan, who teaches him these skills. 
            Over time, she began to bring her sketches to life as digital masterpieces. 
            Each sketch is a combination of patterns, brilliant colours, and design, demonstrating the concept of what fashion may be.

            <br> Days, and nights passed a way, she was focus, forgetting everthing like grandmother.

             Her collection and idea take shape, Maria encounters scepticism from various people, 
                including her friend, who does not understand the concept of fashion that cannot be physically worn. However,
                 her goal to create a more sustainable and innovative fashion sector drove her to strive harder. After days of hard work, she 
              Finally unveils her NFT fashion line in a virtual exhibition in Holborn that attracts students, fashion aficionados, and digital art collectors from all over the world, including the United States. This floating, moving, almost living dresses and diverse suits displayed as Nfts in the virtual captivated and astounded the entire audience.
                 Each piece tells a unique story while reflecting current fashion trends. From there, Nfts got so much popularity, a 2025 was seen as time changed for fashion.
               The main feature of the exhibition is the sale of the Nfts pieces, which were "gown pieces," incredibly lovely garments with clouds streaming in them. This became a huge success, selling a large amount of merchandise, and it had a significant impact on the overall digital fashion sector, and Maria established her name in the field.

            One of the offers, which she  got was from bill gates, a invovative guy, who was fighting for number one placee with elon musk.
            She accepted the offer from bill. She worked closly with bill mangers, and made some new nfts for the fashions.
            Bill started approaching storess in holborn for the fitting room. Then they launch the product.
