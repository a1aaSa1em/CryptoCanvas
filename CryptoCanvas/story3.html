        <p class = "desgin"> George (Graphic Designer)
            He has spent 30 years in advertising and is currently working as an NFT artist.  He has resided in Holborn for the bulk of his adult life.
            In this story , George's trip is more than just discovering a new medium in digital art and visiting the museum. In 2035, there were no museums, but a new industry for digital arts investment emerged.
            George is the person, who was at his late stage of his life.

            George, a brilliant graphic designer, has lived in Holborn, near the British Museum, for the majority of his life. His eyes have witnessed the passing of generations, from adolescence to retirement. For the past 30 years, George has served a variety of things from his window, his artistic spirit capturing each event on his mental canvas.
             As he approached retirement age, George had an idea, an idea of neglecting digital arts in favour of traditional arts in the museum. 
             Time moves slowly, very slowly.One day, while roaming near ual compus, George runs into Tom, a young technician from Ual university
              who is engrossed in the realm of graphic design. Tom was holding some artworks when he bumped intoÂ George, the artwork studdenly
              gonna to the street, 
               resulting in brilliant hues and expressions on the street. As George gathered the pieces of art, his energy was deeply invested in the arts; why not create digital art rather than physical? Motivated by this experience, George bridged the gap between Holborn's unknown talent and the world of digital painting.
              He launches a idea to turn these arts pieces into digital nfts, focusing on the arts in museums.</p>

            As he come near to his  retirement as a graphic designer, he comes up with the notion of developing digital
             arts neglects and then having actual arts in the museum. Time moves slowly, very slowly. 
             One day, while wandering near Ual college, he collides with Tom again. What, again. Georage, ask his name, 
             and describe about his vision of transformming the museum into digital neglect. Tom got impressed. Georage, 
             collboarted  with Tom and other UAL students.

             They all constructed  a virtual exhibition titled "The Unseen Art of Holborn." 
            The exhibition is a digital mosaic of Holborn's existence, where energy, dreams, and youthful creators collided. 
            Each NFT art work that tom was holding, was exhilbited into exhibition, which 
             becomes a part of the arts, and as the value of the arts rises, 
            so will the value of digital nfts.Each NFT becomes a window into a moment, 
            a mood, a hidden part of Holborn, enlivened by the spirit of youth.

            The popularity of this artwork has led to increased investment by many individuals,
            including artists who have neglected their art and posted it online. 
            
            As more people were interested in this,
             they gradually began to purchase expensive items, retain them for a period 
             of time, and then sell them at higher prices. This was a modest change. 
             You know what happened: the actual art was modified. By 2035, there will be no museums dedicated to the arts due to their digital transformation. Visitors were able to experience virtual reality and explore digital artworks, making it a unique experience.

            Everything in Holborn has changed as a result of this, and there are no longer any art museums. Georage's grandma was 17 years old in 2035, and he had no idea how his grandfather changed the world. At the age of 19, this 17-year-old entrepreneur used his grandfather's knowledge and spent heavily in neglects and art, crossing the billion-dollar mark. This demonstrates how artwork nfts have impacted living in 2035.
